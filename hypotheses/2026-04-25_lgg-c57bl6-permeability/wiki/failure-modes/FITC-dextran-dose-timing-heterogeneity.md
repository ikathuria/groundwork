# FD-4 dose & blood-draw timing not standardised

## What it is

Across the FITC-dextran-flagged papers in this wiki, dose ranges across **60–750 mg/kg** and blood-draw times across **1–4 h** post-gavage. The papers use plasma fluorescence as a continuous outcome but do not normalise for dose or timing — making direct effect-size comparisons across studies unreliable.

A 30 % reduction at 4 h post a 600 mg/kg gavage is not the same biological measurement as a 30 % reduction at 1 h post a 60 mg/kg gavage. Plasma FD-4 trajectory is a function of (absorption × distribution × clearance) and the integral changes shape with both dose and time-point.

## Why it matters for this hypothesis

The **30 % reduction threshold** in our hypothesis was specified without anchoring it to a specific protocol parameter. Any meta-analysis that pools "30 % reduction in plasma FD-4" across studies with different doses and times is mixing apples with pears. Pass 3 must:

1. **Pre-register a single dose / time-point** for the primary endpoint.
2. **Acknowledge in literature QC** that the published "LGG reduces gut permeability" effect-size literature is heterogeneous and any cross-study magnitude estimate is uncertain.

## Mitigation

1. Pick one dose × time pair and pre-register it. Recommended: **600 mg/kg, plasma at 4 h**.
2. Optionally collect two time-points (e.g. 1 h and 4 h) for AUC if budget allows — converts a snapshot to a kinetic measurement.
3. When citing prior literature in Pass 3, note dose and time when reporting effect sizes; do not pool across protocols.
