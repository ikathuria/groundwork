# FITC-dextran photobleaching during prep / read

## What it is

Free FITC and FITC conjugates are photolabile under standard fluorescent lab lighting. The fluorescein chromophore loses ~5–15 % of its emission per hour of bench-top exposure under typical lab conditions, and substantially faster under direct lamp / window light. Plate-reader scans add small additional bleaching (negligible per scan but cumulative over re-reads).

The error is **direction-systematic**: bleached probe fluoresces less, so the measured plasma FD-4 concentration is **under**estimated. If the LGG arm samples are processed second (later in the day, more bench-time) than the controls, this can either mask or counterfeit a treatment effect.

## How it manifests

- Within-day signal drift: plate replicates run later in the day are systematically lower.
- Lower-than-expected absolute concentrations vs published.
- Effect-size attenuation: real differences shrink toward null.

## How to detect it

- Run a **FITC-dextran stability control**: one fixed-concentration well left in the dark and one left under typical lighting for the duration of the assay. If they differ by > 5 % at read time, you are bleaching.
- Test re-reading the same plate after 30 min on the bench.

## Mitigation

1. Wrap dosing syringes, reconstituted FD-4 stock, and plasma sample tubes in **aluminium foil** during all bench-top steps.
2. Keep reconstituted FD-4 at 4 °C in an opaque container.
3. Read the plate immediately after sample loading; do not let it sit on the deck.
4. **Randomise sample loading order** across treatment groups so any time-drift averages out across arms rather than biasing one direction.
